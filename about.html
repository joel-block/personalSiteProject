          <h2>My Cats</h2>
          <p>
            My partner and I are pet parents to two mischievous cats named
            Sidney and Ferdie, both pictured to the right. <br />
            Sidney, the fluffy black and grey cat, is the grumpy older man of
            the two, who might have preferred being an only child. Alas, we
            decided to adopt another cat from the same humane society a couple
            years later. <br />
            Ferdie, the brown tabby, either acts like an extra snuggly teddy bear or a rebellious teenager depending on his attitude.

          <h2 class="shift">Queer Community</h2>
          <p>
            My identity as queer person was something that I struggled with growing up, and it is very important to me to stay connected with my local LGBTQIA+ community.<br />
            Where I currently live, there are very few spaces for queer people to gather in a safe, welcoming environment. Eventually, I would like to work with LGBTQIA+ nonprofit or community center to support queer youth and increase local representation.<br />
            When I get the chance, I enjoy going to drag shows and brunches both to support local queer artists and to remain connected to the community.

          <h2>Gaming</h2>
          <p>
            One activity that I enjoy doing to unwind is gaming. I am definitly a Nintendo gamer, and I will always have a special place in my heart for Pok√©mon.<br />
            While some gamers prefer action/adventure games or first-person shooters, I prefer RPGs, especially in a fantasy setting. I have also had some friends tell me to play Dungeons and Dragons, but I haven't found a group yet to enter that world. Maybe one day.

          <h2 class="shift">Travel</h2>
          <p>
            I love exploring new places and experiencing other cultures. Eventually, I would like to say that I have been to each continent. So far, I have been to Spain, France, and Italy in Europe and Japan in Asia.<br />
            While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I studied abroad in Japan for a semester, and I would love go back. I attended Kansai Foreign Language University in Osaka prefecture in Fall 2008. I still have some friends in Japan, and I would love to see them again and introduce them to my partner of 6 years.<br />
            Ideally, I would love to be able to work remotely while travelling, so I could spend more time in my destinations.
